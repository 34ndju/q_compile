# Quantum circuit compiler for continuous gate parameters

In leading ion-trap QC proposals, a universal gate set at the physical level consists of single qubit R<sub>z</sub> and entangling XX gates. Here, we focus on implementing an optimizer focused on single qubit rotations. This also leads to better magic resource reduction in other fault-tolerant, universal gate sets and architectures.
