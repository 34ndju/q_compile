# Quantum circuit compiler for continuous gate parameters

In leading ion-trap QC proposals, a universal gate set at the physical level consists of single qubit R<sub>z</sub> and entangling XX gates. Here, the focus is on implementing optimizations for single qubit rotations. Furthermore, this leads to better magic resource reduction in other fault-tolerant, universal gate sets and architectures. For further details, see [Nam, et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07345)
